# Concept

TO DO
--> Animations will be done in Autodesk Maya
--> Tracking and Partical Systems will be done in Spark AR

## Idea

The main idea behind this project is to create an Instagram filter. It is a glasses filter (designed by the company "NakedOptics", 3D modelled by Mr. Gruber). There are three different glasses to choose. 
Every glass is different in its texture. By doing any gesture (details will follow next time) you can switch between the three glasses. There is also going to be a partical system (e.g. Snowflakes).
