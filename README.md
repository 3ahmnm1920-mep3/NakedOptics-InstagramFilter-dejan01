# NakedOptics-InstagramFilter-dejan01

# Project Description

This Project is goingt to be an Instagram Glasses Filter which is made in Spark AR. It is made for all mobile devices that have Instagram installed. It is a glasses filter (designed by the company "NakedOptics", 3D modelled by Mr. Gruber). There are two different glasses to choose. This Filter is primarly made for the NakedOptics brand in order to advertise some of their glasses on Instagram.
Every glass is different in its texture. By tapping the screen, the glasses will change. An animation will immediately start and will separate the glasses into body, glass and band. What is more, a sound effect is being played during the animation.
Since the glasses are made for skiing, there will also be some falling snowflakes. This can be achieved by using a particle system and a snowflake png. The system uses a picture of a snowflake and let's it for example fall from top to bottom.
